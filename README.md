# sovereign-bitcoiner-slides
These slides are created for you to use in your community meetups. Code Orange Dev School would like to help inspire 10 more Bitcoin Houses by the end of 2026, but this can only happen if we start having quality meeupts and workshops first. These slides are designed to help bitcoiners to level up their meetups in their local communities. PDF and Canva links can be found in this repo. Plebs together strong!
